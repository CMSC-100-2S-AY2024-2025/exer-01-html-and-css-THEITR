            <h1>Autobiography</h1>
            <p style="margin: 10px;"> 
                Since I was a child I have had an interest in programming which first came about from an interest in video games, <br>
                this interest would wane later on in my highschool years, but has recently resurfaced, <br>
                as I managed to pass and enroll in the computer science course in UPLB which gave me an opportunity to learn more about programing. <br>
                This would eventually lead to where I am now in my second semester of my second year in college, as I continue to both enjoy, struggle and continue to try my best in my classes.
            </p>

            <p style="margin: 10px;">
                <span style="color: lightgreen; font-weight: 500;">Perseverance:</span> <br>
                One of my best skills in my opinion, is my ability to persevere and always try my best when doing projects,<br>
                even if the project is not to my liking I am still willing to give it my all, and follow through. <br><br>
                <span style="color: lightgreen; font-weight: 500;">Team Skills: </span><br>
                Another one of my best skills is my ability to properly communicate and work with a team <br>
                <span style="color: lightgreen; font-weight: 500;">Hard working: </span><br>
                while this is a quality that most have, I believe that my willingness to work hard for projects that im not even passionate about is one of my best qualities.
